# Hospital-Information-System
keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project, we have developed an automated version of the manual system, named “Hospital Information System”. The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less hospital. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user system interaction and also provides robust and reliable storage and backup facilities. Our project “Hospital Information System” includes registration of patients, storing their disease details into the system. It will also contain doctor’s information. Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and store the details of every patient and staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current status of each room. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id. The Hospital Management System can be used by entering respective username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. Only the respective person can add data in the database. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected and data processing is very fast, accurate and relevant.
